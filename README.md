# Kaike Southier

### Network & Security Researcher • Data Center Engineering • DDoS Mitigation • XDP & DPI

Welcome — I’m **Kaike Southier**, a researcher and engineer specialized in  
**network security, large-scale telemetry, and resilient infrastructure design**.  
With a background in **IT operations, data center networking, and systems engineering**,  
I work at the intersection of **high-performance packet processing**,  
**deep packet inspection (DPI)**, and **real-time DDoS mitigation**.

My research explores how distributed systems behave under extreme load  
and how we can build intelligent, self-adaptive defenses that protect networks  
at line rate, and above! — from backbone infrastructures to edge PoPs.

## 🧠 Current Focus

- Autonomous mitigation architectures for volumetric and protocol-level attacks  
- High-performance packet processing (XDP/eBPF) and flow telemetry pipelines  
- Ethical research on amplification, reflection, and botnet coordination patterns  
- Deep packet inspection (DPI) and multi-vector detection at scale  
- Data center and carrier-grade network engineering (10–100 Gbps environments)  
- Collaboration between academic, enterprise, and operational security teams

## 🧩 Philosophy

> “Understanding the offense is the key to building better defense.”

All current work is guided by **ethical, data-driven, and transparent research**.  
Every tool, dataset, and experiment is developed within **controlled lab environments**,  
using simulated traffic or authorized honeypots, with the goal of advancing  
real-world network defense and detection capabilities.

## 🧱 Legacy & Transparency

Earlier low-level tooling and experiments from the *forky* era have been  
preserved and gradually restructured under  
[@forkyyy](https://github.com/forkyyy) — now maintained strictly as a  
**technical archive and educational resource** for network-layer research.  
Those projects are being sanitized and repurposed to support mitigation,  
analysis, and reflective-attack prevention, other work from the 'forky' era will also only be posted under that alias.

## 🏢 Professional Background

- Extensive hands-on experience with **data center infrastructure**,  
  **routing/switching**, and **multi-POP network design**.  
- Expertise in **Linux kernel networking**, **raw sockets**, **eBPF/XDP**,  
  and **traffic engineering** for high-throughput systems.  
- Proven track record in **DDoS detection and response**,  
  **flow correlation**, and **automated mitigation frameworks**.  
- Deep involvement in **telemetry collection, DPI analysis**,  
  and development of distributed monitoring systems.
